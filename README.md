# food-item

This webpage was split into sections. First section is to incorporate the
logo and navigation list at the top. The second section is to encompass the
remaining of the webpage with the content.

The content is split by two section. First section is the heading
where we have a background image, centered and used to cover the entire entity
of the heading.
The second part of this section is the food section which is composed of
independent sections: food body, button, and the nutrition menu. Each of the
styling of these sections are depicted in the styles.css file.

index.html does a well job of dividing the sections as well.
